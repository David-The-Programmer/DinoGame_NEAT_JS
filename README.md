# NEAT Dino Game([Demo](https://david-the-programmer.github.io/DinoGame_NEAT_JS/))
This is my first attempt at using NEAT (Neural Evolution of Augmenting Topologies) to play a clone of the Chrome Dino Game.

NEAT is basically the combination of neural networks and genetic algorithms. Not only can the weights of the neural networks can evolve, so can the structure (topology) of the neural networks.

To know more on it, you can click [here](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf) to read the research paper.

## Improvements on code
- [ ] Show best dino of previous generation
- [ ] Show the neural network of best dino
- [ ] Improve on UI: Add buttons to increase/decrease the population size & mutation rate and add button to show best dino
- [ ] Allow player to compete with A.I
- [ ] Make a noticeboard on improvements made by A.I on the side
- [ ] Improve the overall design of webpage

## Built With
[Javascript_NEAT](https://github.com/chuanhao01/Javascript_NEAT) - Library used to train neural networks with NEAT.

[p5.js](https://p5js.org/) - Library used to design the Dino game.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to thank my friend, [@chuanhao01](https://github.com/chuanhao01) for giving a lot of his time and effort (and especially sanity :)) to create the [Javascript_NEAT](https://github.com/chuanhao01/Javascript_NEAT) library.

The sprite images of the cactus, bird and dino are from [Code Bullet](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0e3QhIYukixgh5VVpKHH9Q), credit goes to him for those images.
